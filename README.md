We advise you to use the Linkar Framework for .NET, CORE, JAVA and C.

You can find there a Visual Studio Solution with 4 projects:

3.- Class library. Auxiliary project used by projects 1 and 2

4.- Console application to see how to consume the services

 
First two projects are examples of ASP.NET web services using LINKAR.

One of them is a WCF service project and the other Web API.

The third project is a class library project, which contains the common code used by the web service projects to access LINKAR SERVER through the C library.

And the fourth project is a small console project that shows how to consume web services.
